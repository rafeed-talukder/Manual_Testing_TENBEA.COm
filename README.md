      18 test cases are passed and 6 test cases are failed.
      Note: This failed test cases priority is P2

#### Test Report :
A short summary of test case sheet with Pie Chart which contains

        1. Test Execution Report 
                          a.No of Passed Cases
                          b.No of Failed Cases
                          c.No of Not-Executed Cases

        2. Limitetions                 

#### MindMap :    
For mindmaping this project used Xmind software.

Here is full overview of tenbea.com. Try to cover to test all the features. Also included TESTING DATA & STATUS.


#### Test Metrics : 
Software Testing Metrics are the quantitative measures used to estimate the progress, quality, productivity and health of the software testing proces

         "We cannot improve what we cannot measure" and Test Metrics helps us to do exactly the same.
All Formula are given bellow which are used for this project:

    
    1. Avg No. Test Cases Per Requirments  =  Total No. of Test Cases for all requirments /  No. of Requirments(As per client)

    2. % of Test Cases Executed  =  No. of Test Cases Executed / Total No. of Test Cases are weritten	

    3. % of Test Cases Not Executed  = (No. of Test Cases Not Executed / No. of Test Cases are weritten) * 100

	4. % of Test Cases Passed  =  (No. of Test Cases Passed / No. of Test Cases are Executed) * 100		

	5. % of Test Cases Failed  =  (No. of Test Cases Failed / No. of Test Cases are Executed) * 100		

	6. % of Test Cases Blocked  =  (No. of Test Cases Blocked / No. of Test Cases are Executed) * 100

	7. Defect Density = No of  Defecs Idenitify (Failed) /  No. of Requirments(As per client)

	8. Defect Leackage  = (No. of defects found in UAT /  No of  Defecs Idenitify (Failed) ) * 100	

	9. Defect Rejection Ratio  = (No. of defects Rejected /  Number of Defects Raised as like No. of Test Cases Failed )* 100	

	10. Defect Removal Efficiency (DRE) = A / ( A+B ) * 100													
					* A= No of Defecs Idenified (Failed) 
                    * B= No. of defects found in UAT or by customer

#### Bug Report : 
Create a bug report for submit it to company developer.

Each Bug's Bug Report must contain :

        1.Serial No
        2.Test Case Idenified
        3.Defect Description
        4.Steps to Reproduce
        5.Expected Result
        6.Actual Result
        7.Environment
        8.Module
        9.Severity
        10.ScreenShots
        11.Responsible QA
